        Changes in clothing often took place at timesofeconomic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the
        medieval Caliphate, followed by a long period without significant changes. In eighth-century Moorish Spain, the
        musician Ziryab introduced to Córdoba[14][unreliable source][15] sophisticated clothing styles based on seasonal
        and daily fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred in
        the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks, who introduced clothing styles from
        Central Asia and the Far East.[16]
        Early Western[when?] travellers who visited India, Persia, Turkey, or China, would frequently remark on the
        absence of change in fashion in those countries. In 1609, the secretary of the Japanese shōgun bragged
        inaccurately to a Spanish visitor that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years.[17]: 312–313 
        However, these conceptions of non-Western clothing undergoing little, if any, evolution are generally held to be
        untrue; for instance, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese
        clothing.[18] In imperial China, clothing were not only an embodiment of freedom and comfort or used to cover
        the body or protect against the cold or used for decorative purposes; it was also regulated by strong sumptuary
        laws which was based on strict social hierarchy system and the ritual system of the Chinese society.[19]: 14–15 
        It was expected for people to be dressed accordingly to their gender, social status and occupation; the Chinese
        clothing system had cleared evolution and varied in appearance in each period of history.[19]: 14–15  However,
        ancient Chinese fashion, like in other cultures, was an indicator of the socioeconomic conditions of its
        population; for Confucian scholars, however, changing fashion was oftentimes associated with social disorder
        which was brought by rapid commercialization.[20]: 204  Clothing which experienced fast changing fashion in
        ancient China was recorded in ancient Chinese texts, where it was sometimes referred as shiyang,
        "contemporary-styles", and was associated with the concept of fuyao, "outrageous dress",[21]: 44  which
        typically holds a negative connotation. Similar changes in clothing can be seen in Japanese clothing between the
        Genroku period and the later centuries of the Edo period (1603–1867), during which a time clothing trends
        switched from flashy and expensive displays of wealth to subdued and subverted ones.
